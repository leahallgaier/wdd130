    <p id="When">When I decided to launch our business, I knew that I wanted nothing less than to have zero negative impact on the earth and the environment. We would not be here without Earth, and here at Bunchkins Bakery we take every step possible to apply that knowledge to our business practices. We do this by being intentional about things that could otherwise be approached with a mindset of whatever’s easiest, fastest, or most accessible. Our building is powered by solar energy, we do not utilize single-use plastic, and the dishware we use to serve treats is all sourced secondhand. We source our materials from companies that treat the earth with respect, and we hope this becomes a more normal practice across businesses.</p>

    <p id="All">All of our employees are paid a living wage. We believe that regardless of whether or not someone has a college degree or possesses special skills, there is plenty of money in the world to go around. Several of our employees have families and children to support, and many of them have busy lives outside of work. We want to support them, not as cogs in a machine, but as living, breathing humans, whose lives should not have to revolve around work. Around the time of holidays, including Christmas, New Year’s, Halloween, Valentine’s Day, and more, employees are not required to work but are paid exponentially more if they do, which we believe is only fair both because of their sacrifice and because our business gets increased revenue during these times.</p>
