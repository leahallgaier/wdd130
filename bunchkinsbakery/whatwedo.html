    <p id="Every">Every time you walk into a bakery or restaurant, it’s a feast for all of your senses. Your eyes bounce back the light of a hundred brightly colored treats; your ears are met with hustle and bustle or cozy and calm; your nose is greeted with the warm, sweet, buttery luxury of freshly baked goods. And the second that delectable treat lands on the table, with the sun resting perfectly on the folds of the croissant or the soft cream cheese frosting, as you hold it in your hands and lift it up into your mouth, your taste buds sing a song of celebration.</p>
