    <h2>Leah Allgaier</h2>

    <p>I am from just outside of Chicago; I grew up around a bunch of cornfields and pretty sunsets in the suburbs. I love to go on walks, hikes, runs, watch movies, and make different kinds of art like painting and mixed media; I recently got into upcycling.</p>
    
    <p>I am currently working at Goodwill and I am hopefully going to be able to make more money if I end up getting a degree or at least gaining more skills to be able to support my art if I end up doing that. I'm taking this class because I want to design a website for my art and I think it would be super cool to be able to do that from scratch. If I end up selling my art or at least posting it more, I think it would be nice to have it all on a website outside of a social media account.</p>
